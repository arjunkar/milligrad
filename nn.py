"""
Implementation of various layers needed to define a
simple feedforward neural network.

Built from the scalar Value class which allows for
training by backpropagation in the PyTorch style.

Largely taken from Karpathy's micrograd project, an
educational resource for understanding the high level
functioning of a modern autograd engine.
